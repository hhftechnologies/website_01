This is a making-it-up-as-we-go, building-the-plane-in-the-air type of organization. Look to us if you want a small, startup feel that\u2019s buzzing with possibility. This is different than other newsrooms that have hierarchies and an established "how-we-do-things," decades-old process.'},{type:"text",value:"2. You want to be involved in building something new. Yes, we publish essays, yet plenty of energy goes into perfecting a creative process that's still in its infancy. As part of a small team, your opinion matters a lot."},{type:"text",value:"3. You crave autonomy rather than taking direction. There are plenty of organizations where you can slot into a well-oiled, historically prestigious machine. You'll get an editor, a process, and story assignments. But that also comes with baggage, particularly the creeping conservatism that <a rel=external href=https://medium.com/@tonyszhou/postmortem-1b338537fabc>often accompanies success</a>. This is pretty much the opposite: what you make emerges from your own burning desires\u2014ideas gestating in the back of your head for months (or years!) that you\u2019ve never had the latitude to explore."},{type:"text",value:"4. You're over making noise. We want you to pick projects that don't live and die by the news cycle. You want your work to have a multi-year lifespan. The Pudding underwrites your research interests (go read all the books!) and gives you time (and financial stability) to explore them."},{type:"text",value:"5. Creativity is not a solitary endeavor. If you\u2019re working solo, we\u2019ll give you an editor, or design resources, or coding help. Whatever it takes to execute your vision. What matters is that we help you understand what readers will feel and keep you motivated."},{type:"text",value:"6. Craft matters. We are building tools that make visual storytelling easier. Yet instead of making something for everyone, our tools begin with one group of users: ourselves. Building for general consumer adoption is a noble pursuit, but there\u2019s <a target_blank href=http://snarkmarket.com/2011/7320>something special</a> that happens when a toolmaker builds something for their own creative ambitions."},{type:"text",value:"7. You\u2019re keen on building a following. Most of us started doing this work \u201Con the side,\u201D often on a personal blog. You may have experience wielding your own voice and the thrill of finding readers. We don\u2019t want that to be lost by \u201Cgetting hired\u201D somewhere. Each person needs to have an identity that they'd otherwise cultivate independently."},{type:"text",value:"8. We calibrate our salaries against interactive journalist and data visualization roles.

This allows The Pudding to operate in a purely journalistic space, giving us full creative autonomy on our articles.
