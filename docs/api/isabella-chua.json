She’s particularly interested in social issues - religion, crime, identity, and food. Isabella loves to dig beyond what is ‘commonsensical’ or ‘natural’ to us, by looking at the larger forces (or even accidents), that may have structured these beliefs. While she strives to stay curious about the world by listening to podcasts and taking classes, she’s happiest when eating pastries, cakes, and drinking tea."}}
