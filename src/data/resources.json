Typically, when people ask this, they are asking about the visualization that lives on the internet inside of our stories. Those visuals are most often coded by our team using front-end web languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). We often rely heavily on the <a rel=external href=https://d3js.org/ target=_blank>D3.js</a> JavaScript library and <a rel=external href=https://svelte.dev/ target=_blank>Svelte</a>, a component-based framework."},{"question":"What other JavaScript libraries do you use?","answer":[{"lib":"<a rel=external href=https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama target=_blank>scrollama</a> for scrollytelling"},{"lib":"<a rel=external href=http://scrollmagic.io/ target=_blank>scrollmagic</a> also for scrollytelling"},{"lib":"<a rel=external href=https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/enter-view target=_blank>enter-view</a> to detect when elements enter the screen"},{"lib":"<a rel=external href=http://d3-annotation.susielu.com/ target=_blank>d3-annotation</a> for annotations in D3.js"},{"lib":"<a rel=external href=https://github.com/hsnaydd/moveTo target=_blank>moveto</a> for scrolling to DOM elements"},{"lib":"<a rel=external href=https://refreshless.com/nouislider/ target=_blank>noUiSlider</a> for cross-browser range sliders"},{"lib":"<a rel=external href=https://lodash.com/ target=_blank>lodash</a> for general JS utilities"}]},{"question":"What skills do you recommend I learn to do what you do?","answer":"The answer to this question will vary depending on who you ask. For us, we always recommend that people learn how to solve problems (and fail at things) since that’s a huge part of our daily work. It’s also important to be curious about the world."},{"question":"What is your process for writing a data story?","answer":"You can find our process in its entirety <a rel=external href=https://github.com/the-pudding/FYI/wiki/Editorial-Process target=_blank>here</a>. In short, we each keep a backlog of story ideas (you can find our public one <a rel=external href=https://pudding.cool/backlog/ target=_blank>here</a>) and then routinely pitch those ideas to the rest of the team. Our story ideas tend to take the form of a question that we will then attempt to answer using data. The team provides feedback and then the author can decide which idea(s) to pursue."},{"question":"How long do projects take?","answer":"Our projects usually take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to complete."},{"question":"Do you release your data or code?","answer":"Yup! Whenever possible, we release our data and data analysis scripts in a <a rel=external href=https://github.com/the-pudding/data target=_blank>GitHub repo</a> for public use."}]}
