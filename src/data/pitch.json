What assumptions does it challenge?"},{"lead":"There’s a deeper truth","description":"What does the story reveal (even if it’s buried deep in the essay)? Does the reader leave the essay feeling differently?"},{"lead":"You’re showing, not telling.","description":"Visuals make your argument more accessible and less complex than a thousand-word essay."}],"send":[{"type":"text","value":"If you have a story in mind that you're excited about and that meets our criteria, we would encourage you to complete this <a rel=external href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_L-i3kpTTD2TA-LwRpGKkDZumNUEOjYR7O7xOtocR6A/edit?usp=sharing>worksheet</a> and send it to us at pitches@pudding.cool.

While some of our freelance contributors are capable of completing a visual story from end-to-end on their own, we often collaborate with our contributors. Would you need help with data analysis, writing, design, front-end code, or some other element to tell this story? No matter the division of labor, The Pudding always assigns an editor to each freelance pitch we take on, so that there is always someone to bounce ideas off of and problem solve with you."},{"lead":"Links","description":"Do you have a portfolio, blog, or any other relevant work that you'd like to share with us?"}],"misc":[{"type":"text","value":"We have a standing meeting on Mondays to review submissions and we try to provide feedback, regardless of whether or not we pursue the pitch, within a week."},{"type":"text","value":"Want to know more?

If we collaborate by providing some assistance in a non-editor capacity (e.g., we do the design), we will lower the compensation accordingly."}],"time":[{"type":"text","value":"This varies greatly from contributor to contributor. Many of the people we collaborate with are working full-time elsewhere and have limited time per week to spend on a story. At that rate, projects often take several months to complete. If a contributor has more time available per week to contribute, we do our best to help move stories along at a faster pace."}]}
