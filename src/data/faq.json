There is certainly more than one way to enter this field! Here’s the short version of each of our stories:"},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>Caitlyn</strong> started in psychology / neuroscience research—ended up with a Bachelors in computer science (focus data science / journalism) and a Masters in data visualization. Worked heavily in music journalism throughout college. Spent a couple years transitioning into management as Studio Lead for Polygraph."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>Ilia</strong> studied psychology and political science before pursuing psychological research in graduate school; took a detour into freelance journalism before finding data-driven storytelling through Columbia's Lede program."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>Jan</strong> began a journalism career covering middle school sports for the <a href=https://www.facebook.com/RCTimes/?__tn__=C-R target=_blank>local paper</a> while in high school. Studied journalism &amp; photojournalism in <a href=https://www.wku.edu/schoolofmedia/index.php target=_blank>college</a>. First job was doing <a href=http://jandiehmdesigns.com/#/newspaper-design/ target=_blank>newspaper page design</a>. Transitioned to web design and data journalism from there."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>Kevin</strong> studied philosophy in college, then wrote about tech and culture for a bit before attending Columbia’s Lede program (like Ilia) to pick up data journalism skills."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>Matt</strong> is self-taught, with a degree in business and 7 years of experience making powerpoint slides."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>Michelle</strong> studied computer science and worked as a software engineer before discovering the world of visual, data-driven storytelling (through The Pudding!)."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>Rob</strong> studied public relations in undergrad, and both library science and art history in grad school. Spent more than a decade doing strategic and creative work for arts, culture and media orgs."},{"type":"text","value":"<strong>Russell</strong> went from computer science &gt; creative coding with <a href=https://processing.org/ target=_blank>Processing</a> &gt; interactive <a href=http://hollowdocumentary.com/ trget=_blank>documentary</a> &gt; making games for civic engagement &gt; data journalism at The Boston Globe &gt; The Pudding!"}]},{"id":"skills","question":"What skills do you recommend I learn to do what you do?","answer":[{"type":"text","value":"The answer to this question will vary depending on who you ask. For us, we always recommend that people learn how to solve problems (and fail at things) since that’s a huge part of our daily work. It’s also important to be curious about the world."},{"type":"text","value":"As far as technical skills go, we’ve found that it’s more important for you to find tools that you are comfortable with and can use well rather than trying to learn any (or all) specific programming languages. You’ll need to know how to find or collect data, clean messy data, and make accurate data interpretations before you worry too much about making fancy data visualizations. We typically use and recommend R, Python, SQL or Node.js for data collection and processing work. You can find more about our data process <a href=https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-1 target=_blank>here</a>."},{"type":"text","value":"Once you’ve got those skills down in your language of choice, having a good understanding of basic design principles and human perception of data visualization becomes important. Again, we use a wide variety of tools to create our story designs (everything from Google Docs and hand-drawn sketches to software like Figma or Adobe Illustrator). You can find more information about our design process <a href=https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-2 target=_blank>here</a>."},{"type":"text","value":"Then you can work on bringing those designs online. If your hope is to create interactive graphics for the internet, you will need to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We often use D3.js, a JavaScript library, but we recommend understanding the fundamentals of web development before trying to pick it up. Many forms of data visualization can be created without the use of D3 (read more about other tools we use <a href=#tools>here</a>)."}]},{"id":"open","question":"Do you release your data or code?","answer":[{"type":"text","value":"Yup! Whenever possible, we release our data and data analysis scripts in a <a href=https://github.com/the-pudding/data target=_blank>GitHub repo</a> for public use."},{"type":"text","value":"We also have a public <a href=https://github.com/the-pudding target=_blank>GitHub repo</a> for our front-end builds."}]},{"id":"polygraph","question":"What’s the relationship between The Pudding and your client-focused agency, Polygraph?","answer":[{"type":"text","value":"You’ve probably noticed we don’t have any ads or subscription walls on The Pudding. However, we need to keep the lights on somehow. Enter: Polygraph."},{"type":"text","value":"We run Polygraph with the purpose of sustaining our work on The Pudding. This allows The Pudding to operate in a purely journalistic space, giving us full creative autonomy on our articles. There’s no brand or client or advertisement contract controlling our Pudding projects, nor are we beholden to what gets the most page clicks. We just do what we think is interesting."},{"type":"text","value":"Basically, the wall between The Pudding and Polygraph is a business model embodiment of the editorial/advertising wall in journalism. The Pudding cannot exist without Polygraph, and Polygraph would have no need to exist without The Pudding."},{"type":"text","value":"The only time a brand finds its way on The Pudding is through sponsored posts, like <a href=https://congress.pudding.cool/ target=_blank>this one</a> we just did about congressional tweets with Saleforce’s Einstein API or <a href=https://pudding.cool/2018/11/dearabby/ target=_blank>this one</a> about Dear Abby letters with IBM Watson. Sponsorship allows us to do what we think is interesting with tools we wouldn’t have access to otherwise."},{"type":"text","value":"Despite being for-hire, we make sure our work at Polygraph does align with our mission at The Pudding: tell cool, public-facing stories with data and visuals, just for a purpose-aligned client rather than for… ourselves (and our moms)."},{"type":"text","value":"Interested in wielding The Pudding’s power for your brand? Check out the Polygraph site <a href=http://polygraph.cool target=_blank>here</a>, and send us an email at hi@polygraph.studio."}]},{"id":"time","question":"How long do projects take?","answer":[{"type":"text","value":"Our projects usually take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to complete."}]},{"id":"process","question":"What is your process for writing a data story?","answer":[{"type":"text","value":"You can find our process in its entirety <a href=https://github.com/the-pudding/FYI/wiki/Editorial-Process target=_blank>here</a>. In short, we each keep a backlog of story ideas (you can find our public one <a href=https://pudding.cool/backlog/ target=_blank>here</a>) and then routinely pitch those ideas to the rest of the team. Our story ideas tend to take the form of a question that we will then attempt to answer using data. The team provides feedback and then the author can decide which idea(s) to pursue."},{"type":"text","value":"They then find/collect/analyze data, determine whether they have successfully answered their driving question (or if they should change course to a different question). Once the data has been analyzed, the author creates a storyboard of how they imagine the story to go with any graphics needed to help the reader understand the topic at hand. Last, the story is coded out and put on the internet."}]},{"id":"conference","question":"Will you speak at my event/conference? Can I interview you for a class/project?","answer":[{"type":"text","value":"We are a small team, so as much as we’d love to speak everywhere and to everyone that we’re invited to, we just don’t have the time. If you’d like to invite us to your event, please send us a message at sup@pudding.cool. We are committed to creating meaningfully inclusive spaces, so we follow this <a href=https://opennews.org/projects/speaker-rider/ target=_blank>speaker rider</a> we co-developed with <a href=https://opennews.org/ target=_blank>OpenNews</a>."}]},{"id":"hiring","question":"Are you hiring?","answer":[{"type":"text","value":"Any open positions we have would be posted on our <a href=https://pudding.cool/about/#positions target=_blank>site</a> and on our social media platforms. We’re generally always open to hear <a href=https://pudding.cool/about/#pitch target=_blank>freelance pitches</a>, though, so feel free to send them our way."},{"type":"text","value":"If you’d like to be notified the next time we are hiring, sign up for our <a href=http://eepurl.com/gF8njH target=_blank>mailing list</a>."}]},{"id":"intern","question":"Do you have any internship positions?","answer":[{"type":"text","value":"Our team will not be taking on interns for summer 2021."},{"type":"text","value":"If you’d like to be notified the next time we are looking for interns, sign up for our <a href=http://eepurl.com/gF8njH target=_blank>mailing list</a>."}]},{"id":"swag","question":"Can I have your logo on clothes/stickers/other fun things?","answer":[{"type":"text","value":"Sre can!
